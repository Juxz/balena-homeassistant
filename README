This repo contains my config to run several smart-home and local networking tools using the great Balena Cloud platform.


Guidelines :

1- Create an account on https://www.balena.io/cloud
2- Setup a new balena application and environment variables
3- Flash your raspberrypi3 SD card with a generated image
4- Edit and push this repo to your balena application


Limitations :

1- This repo is tailored for raspberrypi3 (arm) platform. If you want to use it on any other SBC supported by Belena Cloud, you have to edit Dockerfiles
2- All services rely on local storage. The plan is add cloud/remote persistent storage for increased reliability


Balena Environment variables requirements:
- Device level
TZ: 'Europe/Luxemburg'

- Pihole service level
WEBPASSWORD: 'admin'
WEB_PORT: 8089
